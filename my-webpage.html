              <br>I want to visit this city because its a colourful city full of charm.
                <br>There are palaces, museums and streets lined with 
                  faded colonial architecture to explore, bustling markets and boutiques to peruse, 
                  and a contemporary dining scene to enjoy.</p>

              <p>The Reason Why I want to learn portuguese is because
                a large number of people speak Portuguese.
                Places with beautiful tourist attractions have people who speak portuguese.
